## Typeletical : Yet another typing app ⌨️ .

Touch-type till you break your keyboard (in case of Membrane) and enjoy the sound as you type if you have a mechanical one , obviously while improving your typing speed :)

Give it a shot here : [Typeletical](https://typeletical.netlify.app/)

## Features 
- For now it just supports filtering between 3 kinds of word-length .

## Why is another typing app required ?

Hear me out . For some weird reasons , I love to see the  text , large and bold while I type and almost no other site has this . Also , I was bored ... so why not xd.

## What did I use ?

- Good old vanilla *JAVASCRIPT* (no REACT'ing on this).
- Okay okay *HTML*.
- Brutal *CSS* (Dont see the css code if you are a frontend enthusisast :p) .
- Used an external [API](https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home) to fetch random words.

## PS:

1. The javascript code is not at all optimized and contains some duplication (Needs refactoring) . Will work on this .
2. No typing speed support as of now .(Also working on this).
3. Contribute if you want to.
